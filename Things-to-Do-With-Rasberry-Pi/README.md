Things to do with Raspberry Pi
==============================

Looking for more things to do -- shoot me an issue enhancement :smiley:

In order of what first comes to my mind:

1. Capture the file
2. GPIO Remote controlling within Network
3. GPIO Remote controlling and sensing via Firebase
4. Crontab over GPIO for controlling any relay (timed home automation)
5. Crontab alarm clock (it's never gonna let you down!)
6. Raspberry Pi with Raspberry Camera with OpenCV for Robot Vision with Interwebs
7. XBMC Media Center Solution
